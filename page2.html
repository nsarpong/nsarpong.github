      <h2>My core values</h2>
      <p>My three top core values are loyalty, honesty and most important trust. I believe you cant do anything without trust. You cannot be in a friendship, or any type of relationship without trust in it. It is something that can takes months and even years to build and can all fall down in a matter of minutes. </p>
