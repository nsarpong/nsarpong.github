      <h2>My future</h2>
      <p>In the future I aspire to have a career in the medical field specifically in surgery, oncology, or nursing. Other fields I aspire to have a career in is computer science or criminal justice.</p>

      <h2>Goals and dreams</h2>
      <p>One of my biggest dreams and goals in life is to open a business of my own. Kind of like amazon, I want to sell a variety of things including books, hair products, clothes, shoes, accessories, and many more. With the money produced, I would start multiple programs which will teach childrens and teens useful skills and knowledge that can used in the future. For example coding, career classes, SAT/ACT help, how to write taxes, open a bank account, or how to buy a credit/debit card. Things that are useful but arent thought in schools. These programs will be available to everyone no matter your race, finantial status and other factors/ circumstances that cannot be controlled. </p>

      <h2>My core values</h2>
      <p>My three top core values are loyalty, honesty and most important trust. I believe you cant do anything without trust. You cannot be in a friendship, or any type of relationship without trust in it. It is something that can takes months and even years to build and can all fall down in a matter of minutes. </p>
